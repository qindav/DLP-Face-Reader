# PCD Face Loader
Designed for Senior Capstone Project. Now updated with simple socket connections and small support for it.
This was a modified project based off of [threejs' trackball example.](https://threejs.org/examples/misc_controls_trackball.html)
It also uses a socketio file sender found [here.](https://github.com/rico345100/socket.io-file-example)


zaghetto pcd file found [here.](http://groovemechanic.net/three.js/examples/models/pcd/)
bunny files found [here.](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/tree/master/test)
